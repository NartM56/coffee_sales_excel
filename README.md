## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

## Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

  - Seeing as there is a big gap between the sales in different countries, run targeted campaigns in the underperforming regions
  - Customers prefer buying large quantites (1kg and 2.5kg) over small quantities (0.2kg and 0.5kg), suggesting buyers are more inclined to stock up. To improve sales, increase the inventory of the higher quantities and introduce value discounts or a buy one get one free offer. Reducing the storage of the smaller sizes could possibly improve revenue.
  - Continue and push forward with the loyalty program: In order to convert the non-members, consider adverstising a one time sign up discount, along with a free sample pack of coffee of their choice.
