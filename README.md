# Coffee Sales Analysis: Building An Interactive Excel Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project offers an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in designing dashboards and using commonly used Excel tools in order to uncover trends in customer behavior and overall sales. 

Insights and Recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

  - Sales Trends Analysis: Analysis of global sales patterns over time, focusing on
  - Loyalty Program Success: Assessment of loyalty program on sales
  - Coffee Order Attributes: Sales filtered by different coffee sizes and roast types
  - Location Comparison: An evaluation of sales by country

## Data Structure and Initial Checks
The data is structured using 3 tables: orders, customers and products

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Country sales are uneven, with United States leading by a wide margin, which shows opportunities for improvement in other countries, and the risk of relying on one country for all sales.

## Insights Deep Dive

### Sales Trends Analysis:
- Sales have been fluctuating repeadetly throughout the years, with Arabica and Liberica hitting the highest of peaks at around 840 sales during the month. Sales have gone as low as 40 coffee bean purchases during the month. The constant fluctuation could be attributed to the purchases in high bulk, causing the spikes followed by dips.
- Coffee sales experienced the highest during the 4th quarter of each year, due to a good deal of holidays happening during this time, such as Halloween and Christmas. This can also be attributed to the weather during the time, as a hot coffee cup serves a big purpose in many people's days.

### Loyalty Program Success
- Program has been underperforming, as sales through loyalty members has been consistently lower than the sales through unsubscribed members, indicating loyalty program is being run poorly.
- 3 of the top 5 customers in total sales are not enrolled in loyalty program, showing that either the loyalty program is not being advertising with enough effort or the benefits of being in the loyalty program are not worth is unrewarding.

### Coffee Order Attributes
- Purchases of 1kg beans has amassed a total of $11010.75 in coffee sales, with 0.2kg beans collecting a toal of $3307.96 and 0.5 beans making $7029.99. Customers are clearly interested in buying coffee in bulk, with the 1kg bag gaining 232.8% more than the 0.2kg bag and 56.6% more than the 0.5kg bag.
- In 2019 and 2020, light coffee has been outperforming both medium and dark coffee, but so far in 2021, the gap has closed down between the roast types, with light roast earning a total of around $3280, followed by medium roast producing $3225 and dark roast earning $3055.

### Location Comparison
- United States is consuming the most coffee by a considerable margin, totalling $26,268.38 throughout all the years and exceeding the nearest country by 405.76%
- Ireland and the UK have been trailing behind, possibly due to the population, but also to the lack of advertising and marketing of the coffee in the countries.


## Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

  - Seeing as there is a big gap between the sales in different countries, run targeted campaigns in the underperforming regions
  - Customers prefer buying large quantites (1kg and 2.5kg) over small quantities (0.2kg and 0.5kg), suggesting buyers are more inclined to stock up. To improve sales, increase the inventory of the higher quantities and introduce value discounts or a buy one get one free offer. Reducing the storage of the smaller sizes could possibly improve revenue.
  - **Reevaluate loyalty program**: Due to the underwhelming outcome of the loyalty program, consider adverstising a one time sign up discount, along with a free sample pack of coffee of their choice, in order to convert non members into loyal subscribers.
  - **Seasonly marketing**: Due to higher spending during seasonal quarters, inveest more towards campaigns and advertising during those times to fully maximize profit and potential.
  - **Introduce perks of being a top spender** in order to motivate people to become usual spenders, with the hopes of receiving benefits from the spending.
